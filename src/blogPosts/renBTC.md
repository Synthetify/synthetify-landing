**GM!** 👋

We are very pleased with the positive feedback and huge utility previously added collateral tokens.
Currently **$SOL** and **$USDC**, which we added previously, own **46%** of the entire collateral in our app 💰  

That's why we decided to add a new token, to make even more diversified pools of collaterals and increase TVL.  
We hope you will enjoy **$renBTC** as positively as previous tokens! 😎
