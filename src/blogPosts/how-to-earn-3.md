In the second part of the How To Earn series, we will focus on maximizing your profit using mSOL by Marinade.

## What is the difference between mSOL and SOL?

mSOL is a liquid staking token that you receive when you stake SOL on the Marinade protocol. These mSOL tokens represent your staked SOL tokens.
They act as a receipt, allowing you to exchange them back to your staked SOL and the earned rewards. Meanwhile, you can use mSOL in DeFi, while enjoying your staking rewards.

## How can you earn using mSOL in Synthetify?

## Rewards

mSOL is a collateral token therefore you can deposit it and mint synthetic assets on our platform, hence you will receive double rewards,the first one for participating in the debt pool, paid in $SNY (currently around 13%),
the second one for using mSOL, paid in $MNDE (currently around 28%)
Remember, that you can mint a synthetic asset for deposited collateral (mSOL in this case) and then you can earn for trading this synthetic asset.

You can learn more about double rewards [here](https://synthetify.io/blog/msol-rewards)

## Long/short using borrowing

Not so long ago, we introduced a new feature to our application - borrowing.

One of the features of borrowing is the ability to LONG and, soon, SHORT a single asset.

## Self repaying loans

As mentioned above, the APY for mSOL stacking is about 7%.
Interest rate for borrowing xSOL is 4%.
Therefore, this pair is called self-repaying.

How to use it?
For example, when adding liquidity, the APY for delivering xSOL may be higher than mSOL.
In this case you earn for:

- Staking mSOL
- Participating in the debt pool
- Using mSOL as collateral
- Liquidity mining

Sounds better than just hodl, right?
