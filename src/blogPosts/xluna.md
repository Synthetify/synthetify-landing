**GM!** 👋

Some time ago we added new collateral tokens and now it's time for a new synthetic asset!  

**The first new added asset is LUNA by Terra Money**  

We are going to start adding new synthetic assets soon.
However, next time, we want to **let you decide what asset will be added next** 😎  
To give you a choice, we will be creating polls on our Twitter account 🐦  
Your opinion is very important to us! 🤗

**What are synthetic assets?**  
Synthetic assets closely track the price of specific assets assigned to them e.g. xBTC will have the same price as BTC on centralized exchanges. Synthetic assets have a form of the [SPL-Token](https://spl.solana.com/token) and can be freely transferred between wallets or used in other DeFi applications. Prices of all synthetic assets are provided by decentralized oracles built on top of the Solana blockchain ⚡


**What is LUNA and Terra Money?**  
**Terra:**  
The Terra protocol is a decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for algorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and decentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency 💵

**Luna:**  
Token used for governance and mining. Users stake Luna to validators, who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees.
