**GM!** 👋  
We decided to increase the collateral ratio, health factor and change liquidation penalty.

Now, these values are as follows:  
💊 Health factor 80% -> **90%**  

🛡️ Collateral ratios:  
 🔹 USDC 80% -> **85%**  
 🔹 renBTC 70% -> **80%**  
 🔹 SOL 60% -> **70%**  
 🔹 mSOL 50% -> **70%**  
 🔹 whETH 60% -> **70%**  
 🔹 whFTT 50% -> **60%**  
 🔹 SNY 30% -> **35%**  



**What will it change?** 🤔  
In short, you'll be able to mint more synthetic assets having the same amount of collateral. 🤑
Also, when you'll be liquidated, you loss less collateral 😎

**How much exactly?**  
For example, consider you deposited 100$ in USDC 💲

**Liquidation penalty**  
Previously the ratio in liquidation penalty was 5/5.  
It meant that 5% of the liquidated amount went to the liquidator and another 5% to the protocol.  
Now, we're changing this ratio to 8/1.
This means that the liquidated amount will be lower by 1%. Of which 7% will go to the liquidator and 1% to the protocol
