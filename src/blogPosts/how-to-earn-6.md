If you feel bearish and want to set a short position, but without choosing one, exact token, we have a perfect solution for you.  
**Short the entire market using Synthetify Debt Pool.**  
(To be exact, with this method, you can short all active synthetics simultaneously (except xUSD) available on our platform.)

## Survival solution for a bear market using Synthetify

No matter if we have already entered the bear market or not - we need to think of an effective plan.
Fortunately, there are many ways to survive or even make a profit during this period.  
We have already described some strategies, such as:

1. [Liquidity mining How to earn #3: Liquidity Mining - Synthetify](https://synthetify.io/blog/how-to-earn-3)
2. Using Synthetify for high APY rewards by using [stSOL](https://synthetify.io/blog/stsol) and [mSOL](https://synthetify.io/blog/msol-rewards)
3. [Short single asset](https://synthetify.io/blog/leverage)

Further in the text, we will provide you with a quite different strategy, which is the main topic of this post.

## Shorting all synthetic assets at once

It's a truly effortless process. All you need to do is hold your entire debt in xUSD. By doing so, you become an xUSD debt pool participant and play against all other synthetic assets. You bet their value will decrease, so you basically play short on them. It is an ideal solution for a bear market when token prices are certain to decline.

If you wish to fully understand the method, we recommend you review the case scenario we provided in our blog post - [Debt pool explanation](https://synthetify.io/blog/debtpool-explanation)
