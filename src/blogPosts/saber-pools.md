**GM!** ðŸ‘‹

We are delighted to finally announce that our **synthetic tokens** are finally **available** on the **Saber** platform ðŸ’¥

This means that you will finally **be able to buy our synthetic tokens** by swapping them with another token on Saber.
It will solve the problem that many recently complained about.
That is, when there was not enough xUSD to burn your debt ðŸ”¥

The second feature introduced by Saber is the **liquidity pool**. 
This means that you will now be able to take part in providing liquidity on our tokens and reap the benefits.

If you'd like to know more about **Saber**, check out their [twitter](https://twitter.com/saber_hq?source=collection_about-------------------------------------) and [website](https://saber.so/).
