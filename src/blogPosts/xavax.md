**What are synthetic assets?**  
Synthetic assets closely track the price of specific assets assigned to them e.g. xBTC will have the same price as BTC on centralized exchanges. Synthetic assets have a form of the [SPL-Token](https://spl.solana.com/token) and can be freely transferred between wallets or used in other DeFi applications. Prices of all synthetic assets are provided by decentralized oracles built on top of the Solana blockchain ‚ö°


**What is Avalanche and AVAX?**  
**Avalanche:**

**AVAX:**
