**GM!** 👋

As we want to make our application as much user-friendly as possible, we are very pleased to introduce new collateral tokens:

* **$whETH**
* **$whFTT**  

We believe that additional collateral tokens will help us in further diversification of collateral pools and will increase TVL.  
We are going to set $whETH’s collateralization level at 60% and $whFTT’s one at 50%.
