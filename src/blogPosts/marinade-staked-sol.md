**GM!** üëã

When we asked what collateral token we have to add next, you often suggested us **$mSOL**.

Therefore, we are happy to announce that from today you can use this token as a collateral in our application.  
Your opinions are very important to us! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

We are excited that we can cooperate with another young and future-oriented project from the Solana ecosystem, which, just like us, started at Hackathon üî•  


**About $mSOL and Marinade**  
Marinade.finance is a liquid staking protocol built on Solana. People stake their Solana tokens with Marinade using automatic staking strategies and receive "staked SOL" tokens they can use in the world of DeFi or to swap any time back to original $SOL tokens to unstake.

If you'd like to know more about **Marinade**, check out their [twitter](https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance) and [website](https://marinade.finance/).
